### Open edX Release Files

Those files are used to remove duplicates from the theme files by `skim.py`.

To update the files go to the [Open edX Releases project on Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/open-edx/open-edx-releases/content/) and download
the English translation to this file.

For next releases the both the filename and the `skim.py` needs to be updated.
